description: 

this is a main window that will execute all the games in one option window.
it is simple 
it just contains the games in a button option you click and it will open the game
but the down side is that it will destroy the main window making your run it again if you want to choose another game

the things that stands out is the buttons color change while you hover in and out of them 
it just uses two more functions and bind widget to make it.
